# Faasos_Analysis_Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer orders, delivery efficiency, and business performance for Faasos. Using SQL, key insights were derived to optimize order fulfillment, driver performance, and customer satisfaction.

## Key Business Problems Solved
ðŸ“Œ Roll Metrics
- Total rolls ordered and unique customer orders
- Number of successful orders delivered by each driver
- Distribution of rolls by type (veg vs. non-veg, with exclusions/extras)
- Maximum rolls delivered in a single order
- Customer order patterns: orders with changes vs. no changes
- Peak order times: hourly and daily trends


ðŸ“Œ Driver & Customer Experience
- Average time taken by drivers to pick up orders from headquarters
- Relationship between order size and preparation time
- Customer travel distances and delivery time insights
- Longest and shortest delivery times recorded
- Driver speed analysis and trend identification
- Success rate of each driver

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains order details, customer preferences, driver performance, and delivery times.
It includes information such as:

- Order ID, Customer ID, and Driver ID
- Types of rolls ordered (veg/non-veg, exclusions, extras)
- Order timestamps (order time, pickup time, delivery time)
- Distance traveled and delivery times

## Future Scope
- Expanding the analysis to include customer retention metrics and order frequency trends.
- Building Power BI dashboards for better visualization of key findings.
- Applying predictive modeling to forecast order demand and delivery times.

## Technologies Used
- SQL for querying and data analysis

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into order trends, delivery efficiency, and customer behavior, helping optimize Faasos' operations and enhance the overall food delivery experience.
